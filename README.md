# Animal Image Classifier

A deep learning-powered web application that classifies animal images into 15 categories using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model. This project demonstrates the practical use of transfer learning for computer vision tasks and is deployed with a lightweight Streamlit interface.

## Project Overview
This project leverages MobileNetV2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, fine-tuned on a custom animal dataset. It provides real-time predictions via an intuitive web interface, built with Streamlit and deployable on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.

## Supported Classes
- Bear
- Bird 
- Cat
- Cow
- Deer 
- Dog
- Dolphin
- Elephant
- Giraffe
- Horse
- Kangaroo
- Lion
- Panda
- Tiger
- Zebra

## Tech Stack
- **Model Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces 

## Features
- Upload `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` images.
- Real-time predictions with top-3 results.
- Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations for model interpretability.
- Bar chart of class confidence scores.
- Clean UI with error handling and confidence alerts.
